This is a fork of the build code for [NextCloudPi](https://nextcloudpi.com).

NextCloudPi is a ready to use image for Raspberry Pi, Odroid HC1, rock64 and other boards.

This version is modified in such a way, that you can install it directly on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Foss.

This code also generates the NextCloudPi docker images for [all architectures](https://hub.docker.com/r/ownyourbits/nextcloudpi), and includes an installer for any Debian based system.
